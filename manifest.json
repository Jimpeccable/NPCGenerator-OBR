Ok... so, now the generator doesn't work but for the first time - is shows in Owlbear Rodeo!!

Here is the manifest:

{
  "name": "NPC Generator",
  "description": "Generates random NPCs for Owlbear Rodeo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "James",
  "icon": "https://npc-generator-obr.onrender.com/icon.svg",
  "manifest_version": 1,
  "action": {
    "title": "NPC Generator",
    "icon": "https://npc-generator-obr.onrender.com/icon.svg",
    "popover": "https://npc-generator-obr.onrender.com/index.html",
    "height": 500,
    "width": 400
  }
}

The last time it worked - although didn't show in owl bear rodeo it had these files.
